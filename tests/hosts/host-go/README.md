# Host-go test CLI

This package is a test-only CLI for interacting with the host-go package. It exists to allow the host-agnostic tests to execute the host-go package and assert that its behaviour is both correct, and matches that of any other host implmentations. 

It is not production code and should not be treated as a good example of how to interact with the library.  This CLI should not be used outside of the test environment.
