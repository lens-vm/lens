# Lens integration tests

This package contains a host-agnostic suite of tests for asserting the behaviour of each host implementation.  It asserts that behaviour of each host is both expected, and the same as every other host implementation.

This test suite currently happens to be written in Go, but it does not have to be and the fact that it is currently written in Go has no significance.
